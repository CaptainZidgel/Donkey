roadmap
-------
enable subscriptions to TF2 update messages. This will probably be hard to test because Tf2 doesn't get updated, would have to be tested with a different RSS feed, in which case maybe it would be better to create a general RSS subscription feature?  
enable subscriptions to Minecraft update messages. Need minecraft to fix their RSS first :^)  
enable 24/7 [pizza music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW0W7j04iRQ) in voice channel. Need to learn voice API first.  
enable subscriptions to youtube channels, probably won't get added in because Youtube's API looks complicated and I hate learning things  
whatever else I want to put in B^)
