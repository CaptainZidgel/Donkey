Roadmap
-------
**Long term**  
enable 24/7 [pizza music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW0W7j04iRQ) in voice channel. Need to learn voice API first.  
whatever else I want to put in B^)  
**Short term**  
Error messages/foolproofing   

A lot of what I want(ed) to add seems beyond my ability at this point. This bot was never meant to really have a function, just be functional. So for now you can +ping and +exit the bot to your heart's content. You can even make it +join and +leave voice channels! It just can't do anything there.  

Oh I just remembered I used to see a chat room game that involved basically a dressed up 'what number am i thinking of game' but it was dressed as "there's a bomb with three switches. Which switch do you flick?" everyone in the chat flicks a random switch and the bot says who survived (by flicking the right switch). Seems like it would be fun to have.
